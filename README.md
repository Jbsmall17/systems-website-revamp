This repository originates as a fork from the portfolio of a seasoned full-stack developer who guides my progress on this venture. 
The project at hand aims to create a proposed website for the Department of Systems Engineering at the University of Lagos.
Within this endeavor, I'm actively collaborating with a diverse and cross-functional team, including designers, developers, and product managers. 
My pivotal role in this collaborative effort involves crafting an intuitive, interactive, and meticulously designed website that aligns 
precisely with the provided design concept, ensuring its visual allure.

Important Notes:

1.The project is in a continuous development phase.
2. It leverages the React framework.
3. This repository mirrors the primary repository where I contribute my work.
