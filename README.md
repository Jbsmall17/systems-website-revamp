# Department of systems enginnering website revamp
This project involves overhauling a website for the Department of Systems Engineering. React, along with various libraries from its ecosystem, was employed to develop the website. A cross-functional team, comprising frontend and backend developers, as well as a project manager, collaborated on this endeavor. Within this team, I served as a frontend developer under the supervision of a senior developer.
